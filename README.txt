# Autonomous Car Project  
A mechatronics project featuring autonomous navigation and manual remote-control mode, built using microcontroller-based control, custom-designed chassis, and 3D-printed components.

1. Project Overview
This project is a small robotic car capable of operating in two distinct modes:

1. Autonomous Navigation Mode 
   The car uses onboard logic to drive automatically based on sensors, obstacles, or defined paths.

2. Remote Control Mode  
   The user can control the car manually using WiFi and a Joystick Module.

The mechanical structure is designed using CAD software, and the printable components are available as STL files.

##  2. Repository Structure
    src - has all code files
    CAD and STL - CAD file and printable STL file
    A simple wiring or connection file
    A readme file to explain all the code.

Keep pulling and pushing when possible!
